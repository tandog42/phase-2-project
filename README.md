 # Project Overview.
This application used a json-server to create a RESTful API to allow us to view/add information! It also includes four client side routes using React Router. They are Home, Trucks for Sale, Add Truck, About. That will flawlessly navigate the user within the app. If you navigate to Truck for sale tab, using a Get request we can successfully display the list of trucks. The Add a Truck route allows the user to submit there own truck using a form. That when the form is submitted, It will add the users truck to the trucks list and display it.
